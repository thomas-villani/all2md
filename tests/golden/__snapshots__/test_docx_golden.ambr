  # Table Test Document

  Here is a simple table:

  | **Name** | **Age** | **City** |
  |---|---|---|
  | Alice Johnson | 25 | New York |
  | Bob Smith | 30 | San Francisco |
  | Carol Davis | 28 | Los Angeles |


  Here is a more complex table with merged cells:

  | **Product** | **Q1** | **Q2** | **Total** |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Product A | 100 | 150 | 250 |
  | Product B | 200 | 180 | 380 |
  | **Total** | **300** | **330** | **630** |

  # Document Heading 1

  This is a simple test document.

  Second paragraph with **bold** text and *italic* text and ***both***

  Here’s some <u>underlined text</u>.

  Here we want a longer paragraph that can span a few lines in a document. It should be like 3 or 4 sentences, which is the normal length of a paragraph. We can even include some **formatting** for emphasis. It’s getting pretty long now, I think we’re almost done.

  ## First Section Heading

  Right before this was the equivalent of an “h2” heading. Now we have some more stuff in this section. I think a [hyperlink](https://example.com/) would be cool.

  Now for an unordered list:

  * First item on unordered list
  * Second item
  * Third

  Let’s add some more stuff

  ## Second Section Heading

  And here’s an ordered list:

  1. First item on ordered list
  2. Second item on ordered list
  3. Third item on ordered list

  And now a multilevel list:

  * First level
  * First level 2
    - Second level 1
    - Second level 2
  * First level 3
  * First level 4
    - Second level 3
    - Second level 4
  * First level 5

  And a simple table with a header:

  | Header A | Header B | Header C | Header D |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 | Rol 1, Col 4 |
  | Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 | Row 2, Col 4 |

  We’ll put an inline image:

  ![Some really cool alt text]()

  And the end.

  Advanced Document

  This document contains more advanced Microsoft word features. In this document, we will use some footnotes, endnotes, and leave comments.

  Here we go!

  The first footnote will come in this sentence<sup>1</sup>. And now this sentence can have an endnote<sup>end1</sup>. It’s just that easy. I’m telling you, it’s quite simple. Although, it’s strange to use *both* endnotes<sup>end2</sup> **and** footnotes<sup>2</sup>. Usually someone would choose one or the other, not usually both.

  Now we can have another paragraph here. This one won’t have any endnotes or footnotes. However, it will have a comment. Something hilarious I’m sure.

  This should probably be all we need for the test document. So buh bye!

  <div id="fn-1"> The first footnote</div>

  <div id="fn-2"> Footnotes are this.</div>

  <div id="fn-end1"> Here’s an endnote.</div>

  <div id="fn-end2"> Endnotes are this.</div>
