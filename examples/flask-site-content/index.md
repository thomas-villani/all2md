# Welcome to My Markdown Site

This is a demonstration of **all2md** powering a Flask-based markdown website. This site showcases the library's ability to:

- Parse YAML frontmatter from markdown files
- Convert markdown to beautiful HTML
- Build dynamic websites with automatic post listings
- Support custom URL slugs and metadata

## Features

### Automatic Post Listing

The home page automatically scans the `blog/` directory and displays all posts sorted by date (most recent first). Each post's metadata is extracted from YAML frontmatter.

### Clean URLs

URLs are generated from either:
- Custom `slug` field in frontmatter
- Or automatically from the filename

### Custom Styling

The site includes responsive CSS styling that looks great on all devices.
